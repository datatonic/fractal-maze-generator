
World's Smallest Simplest Maze Generator
----------------------------------------

Yes folks, this is the world's smallest and simplest maze
generator.  The algorithm is only 3-5 lines of code!
I originally invented the algorithm when I was in
elementary school and I thought maybe someone out
there can appreciate how simple algorithms can
actually create complex patterns.  Think of it
as fractal for mazes or mandelbrot for mazes, where
a simple formula can generate complex patterns.

Note that the font affects the look of the maze,
so get a font that has slashes that extends to the
corners.  The default PSP one leaves gaps.  Tilt your
PSP slightly for common viewing angle.  Re-run the
program for another maze.  Source is included.

Installation Guide
------------------
This is a homebrew program for the Sony PSP (PlayStation Portable).
It runs on a PSP with firmware 1.0 or 1.50.  It also runs on higher firmware
if that firmware supports running firmware 1.50 or 1.00 homebrew.

Firmware 1.5: Copy everything inside directory "firmware1.5/" from ssmg.zip to
              your memory stick's "/psp/game/" directory.

Firmware 1.0: Copy everything inside directory "firmware1.0/" from ssmg.zip to
              your memory stick's "/psp/game/" directory.


Note if you are running a custom firmware, make sure that it is set up to 
run 1.50 firmware inside directory "ms0:/psp/game/" (where ms0: is the root of
your memory stick).  So if it is currently set up to run in "ms0:/psp/game150",
make sure you change it to the original directory structure of "ms0:/psp/game".
